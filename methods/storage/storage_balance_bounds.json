    "description": "This will  be returned for the method `storage_balance_bounds`. Both `min` and `max` are string representations of unsigned 128-bit integers.`min` is the amount of tokens required to start using this contract at all (eg to register with the contract). If a new contract user attaches `min` NEAR to a `storage_deposit` call, subsequent calls to `storage_balance_of` for this user must show their `total` equal to `min` and `available=0` .  A contract may implement `max` equal to `min` if it only charges for initial registration, and does not adjust per-user storage over time. A contract which implements `max` must refund deposits that would increase a user's storage balance beyond this amount.",
